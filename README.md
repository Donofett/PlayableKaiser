<h2>Work on update 4.0 is in progress. This will take considerably longer than past updates, as we are adding lots of new content (HOI4-esque focus tree) and heaps of polish.</h2>

<h1>Playable Katzenartig Imperium</h1>

IT IS HERE

Playable Katzenartig Imperium has been created!

However, it is fully armed and operational. If you notice anything buggy, weird, or broken, please let me know.

You start as the Katzenartig Imperium on a Flusion with the other nations still around and with a crippling lack of FTL. In order to expand properly, you need to conquer Flusion through the custom ui or contacts menu and declaring war. However, be warned that the nations will fight back, and if you lose a war you lose a pop and territory! 

Eventually, if you take too long, the Flusionian Coalition can form. Consisting of every surviving nation, they will pitch in armies to defeat you once and for all. If you lose that battle, you lose the game!

Other notes:

Sometime after a year of a unified Flusion, you gain the option to start researching FTL.
Many of the Katzen unique features are techs that must be researched, such as the unique ships or the Flusio-Arcology.
There is a unique tradition tree, the Kaiserism tree.
In order to start Project Mondkanone, you have to take the Kaiserism tree and perform a council agenda.
In order to mobilize the moon, you have to finish the tree and take the Flusio-Supremacy ascension perk.
The Kaiser Moon can be recalled to Jublio via a decision on Flusion.

Please use the Katzenartig empire preset at the bottom on the empire selection screen. We cannot ensure the intended experience without it.
